Understanding the Interface
=============================

When you first launch the Field Survey application, the following icons are displayed.

<icon> **Manage Users**
---------------------

Before you start using FLOW, you first need to create one or more users. During data collection, a specific user needs to be selected so that you can later track the collected data to the field worker who conducted the survey. 

The Manage Users feature allows you to create and edit users, and select a particular user for a session. 
  
<icon> **Review Saved Surveys**
---------------------------

When you have to stop a survey midway and then continue it later, you can retrieve the partly filled survey using the Review Saved Surveys feature. (For example, you might have to take the GPS location at a water point, and then walk a distance to interview someone to complete the rest of the survey.)  

**This feature gives you quick access to**:
-	Surveys that were saved but not submitted - Click on the survey name to open the survey and continue entering responses.
-	Submitted surveys – Click on the Menu   icon and then choose Submitted Surveys. You can view a previously submitted survey, but not edit it.

For details on the options available on this feature, see Survey Menu Options.

<icon> **Settings**
-----------------------

You can use the Settings menu to customize the application as you require, and to perform various other administrative actions. The Preferences option within the Settings menu allows you to configure the way the application should display and handle data.


Some features are available to all users while others can only be accessed by administrators and require an administrator access code.

The following table lists the recommended settings for the options within the Preferences menu.
<table>
Preference	Recommended Setting
Search radius for points	? < caetie>
Keep the last-selected user logged in between sessions 	  Enable. Ensures that you do not have to select a user every time you launch the application.

Automatically upload app errors	Select Always. This records any errors your phone experiences and sends it to FLOW support staff who can then help resolve the errors.
Pre-cache data and help media	Select WiFi only. This ensures that non-critical components such as help media are downloaded only when you are connected by WiFi.
Data Server	Automatically set to the FLOW server address. Do not change.
Device Identifier	Enter a name for the device, for example, ‘kenya01’. This ID is used to identify and keep track of the devices on the FLOW Dashboard.
