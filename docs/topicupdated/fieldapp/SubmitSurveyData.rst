Submitting Survey Data
==============================

When you complete a survey, you must submit it for upload to the FLOW server for storage and analysis. Immediate submission is recommended so that data backup is available in case your phone is lost or damaged. 

When you click Submit at the end of a survey, the survey is locked to prevent further editing, and uploaded to the FLOW server immediately. If network connectivity is not available, the survey is stored in the phone until connectivity is restored.
*Note: Ensure that the date and time setting on your phone is correct before you submit a survey.*
