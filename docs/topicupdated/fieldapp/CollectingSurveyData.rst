Collecting Survey Data
=======================
 
Surveys that are assigned to your phone appear on the Field Survey home screen when you launch the application. When you click the survey icon, the survey opens, allowing you to enter responses to the questions. When you finish entering responses, you submit the survey and the data is sent to the FLOW server, where it will be computed and analyzed.

Before you begin collecting data, you must understand the following:

Survey Structure 
-----------------

Each survey contains a series of questions and the questions are organized into smaller sets as question groups.  Each group of questions appears in a separate tab on the screen. You can fill in the questions in any order, moving from tab to tab.  

Question Types 
------------------

Surveys can consist of a number of different question types.

- **Dependent Questions** � Based on the answer to a question, additional questions are displayed or hidden. 
 
- **Geo Questions** - use the device�s GPS chip to automatically fill in latitude, longitude and elevation. Click the Check Geo Location button to fill in these questions.

- **Photo and Video questions** � present the option to take a photo or video to supplement your data. Click the Take Photo or Take Video buttons to use the phone camera. A green check mark appears beside the photo question to indicate that a photo has been taken. 

*Note: To preview the photo, long-click the checkmark. Press the back button to close the preview. If you wish to replace the photo, click Take Photo again to retake the picture.*

Help Options
------------

Surveys can be configured to include help options. Help can take the form of text, a series of images or a video. If help is available for a specific question the help   icon is displayed next to the question text. Click this icon to open the help tool.

If an administrator has configured additional help options in the survey, you will have access to the following tools:

- **Nearby Points** - This tool helps you track the performance of water points over time. It shows you a list of previously mapped points sorted by distance (from nearest to farthest) from your current location. If a point on the list matches the point being surveyed, you can select it to ensure that the existing information about that point is updated in the database.

- **Waterflow Calculator** - This feature allows you to enter available parameters and calculate how well a water point is functioning.
 

Saving a Survey
-----------------

Surveys responses are automatically saved as you answer them. If you want to save a partially completed survey for later and begin a new survey, use the Save and Start New menu option.

The following table explains the options displayed in the Survey menu.

                          languages. 
                          *Note: The survey may take a few seconds to
