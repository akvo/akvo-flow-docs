Installation Prerequisites
=============================

Before you install the Field Survey application on your phone, ensure that your phone is in proper working condition. Place the SD card, the SIM card, and the battery in the phone, and make sure you can send and receive calls and data. Once this is done, ensure that your phone is configured to do the following:

-	Send and receive email. <link>
-	Download third-party software. <link>

Configure Gmail on Phone
---------------------------
A free Gmail account is necessary to enable access to the FLOW Dashboard, and to receive software updates. 

It is best to use a dedicated email address for communication with the phone. If you intend to use multiple phones with the Field Survey application, use the same email address for all the phones, so that you can send software updates to all the phones simultaneously.

1.	From the home screen of the phone, press **Settings**. 
 
2.	Under Accounts & Sync or Accounts, press **Add account**.
 
3.	From the list of options, select **Google**. 

4.	You are prompted to specify whether you want to create a new Google account or use an existing one. Choose **New**.
	*Note: If you already have a Gmail account that can be dedicated for communication with the FLOW server, choose 'Use an existing one'.* 
 
5.	Follow onscreen prompts to create your Google account.

The new account will now be visible under **Applications > Email**.

Configure Android Settings for Software Download
---------------------------------------------------

Your phone must be configured to allow download and installation of third-party software, so that you can download and install the Field Survey application, and other recommended software.

**To enable software download**:

1.	Under Settings, select **Security**.
 
2.	Enable **Unknown Sources**. If you cannot find the Unknown Sources option under Security, check under **Applications**.
