Downloading Surveys
=========================

If you have successfully installed the Field Survey application on the phone, and have internet or network connectivity, your phone is ready to receive surveys. 

There are three ways to get a survey from the FLOW server onto your phone:

-  Assign a survey to your phone from the FLOW Dashboard.
-	Download the survey from the Settings menu on the Field Survey application installed on your phone.
-	Generate a bootstrap file containing the survey from the FLOW Dashboard and manually transfer the survey to your phone using a USB cable.

Every time the Field Survey application is launched, it checks for newly assigned surveys and updates to existing surveys. If there are new or updated surveys available, these are downloaded automatically. When new or updated surveys have been downloaded, the status bar shows a notification.

When you launch the application, the phone sends a signal to the web-based FLOW Dashboard to indicate that your device is available for survey assignments.  On the Dashboard, your device ID appears in the list of devices that are available for selection when you assign surveys to phones. Assigned surveys are automatically downloaded from the FLOW server when your phone is turned on, provided you have internet or network connectivity. Shortcuts to these surveys appear on the Field Survey home screen.  

If you have administrator privileges, you can also search for a particular survey in the FLOW database and download it to the phone. You can only download surveys that have been created and approved in FLOW. Before you start, write down the survey ID of the survey you wish to download. To find the survey ID, log in to the FLOW Dashboard, locate the survey and view its details. 

To download a survey from the FLOW database:

1.	On the Field Survey home screen, press Settings. 
 
2.	From the list, select Download Survey.
 
3.	Enter the Authorization passcode 12345 and click OK.
 
4.	Enter the Survey ID of the survey you wish to download and click OK.
 
The shortcut to the downloaded survey appears on the Field Survey home screen. Use the shortcut to launch the survey.
*Note: If the downloaded survey does not appear immediately on the home screen, close the application and reopen it.*
