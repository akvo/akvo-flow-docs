Getting Started
===================

Before you start using the Field Survey application, you must do the following on your phone:

- Connect the phone to a Wi-Fi network or mobile data connection.
- Set the Access Point Name (APN) 
- Calibrate GPS 

Connect to a Wi-Fi Network
--------------------------

In order for the phone to update surveys, receive new surveys or transmit submitted surveys, the phone must have a cellular plan with data or must be connected to Wi-Fi. A Wi-Fi internet connection is the easiest way to connect to the FLOW server for data exchange.

 For off-line alternatives in situations where an internet or data connection is unavailable, see 'Handling Network Connectivity Issues'_.


To connect the phone to a Wi-Fi network:

1.	On the home screen of the phone, press Settings. 
2.	Under Wireless and Network, the default setting for Wi-Fi is OFF. Tap on OFF to change it to ON. 
3.	Select Wi-Fi. A list of available Wi-Fi networks displays. 
4.	Choose the network you have access to and provide the password, if prompted. 
5.	Select Connect. When connected to Wi-Fi, you can see this  icon at the top of the screen.

Set Access Point Name (APN)
----------------------------

Local Internet Service Providers use APN settings to activate data plans using SIM cards on phones that were purchased abroad. Every service provider has different APN settings and they change these settings periodically for security reasons. 

When you purchase the SIM cards, ask the Internet Service Provider to give you the correct APN settings for the SIM Card.

To set the Access Point name:

1.	On the home screen, press Settings. 
 
2.	From the options, choose More... and then select Mobile Networks.
 
3.	Select Access Point Name.
 
4.	Press the Menu   button and select New APN.
 
5.	Fill in the required APN settings for your SIM card. You can get the correct APN settings for the SIM Card from your Internet Service Provider.
 
6.	Press the Home key when you are done.

Calibrate GPS 
-----------------

Every time the phones are moved more than 600 miles (500 kilometers) from the last location where they were calibrated, the GPS system needs to be re-calibrated to ensure GPS coordinates are accurate. The calibration can be done with or without a SIM card in the phone.

If the SIM cards and APN are set correctly on the phone, the calibration process takes only a few minutes. If these are not set correctly, it can take up to 30 minutes.

To calibrate GPS: 
 
1.	Take the phone outside to a location where there is a clear view of the sky. It makes no difference whether the sky is cloudy or clear.
2.	On the phone Home screen, click the GPS Status   icon.
3.	If your GPS is disabled, you are prompted to enable GPS. Select Use GPS Satellites and then return to the previous screen. The GPS application appears.
 
4.	Wait until the margin of error appears and is 9 or less. This can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes.
