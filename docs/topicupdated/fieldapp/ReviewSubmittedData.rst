Review Submitted Data
==================================


Uploaded data can be viewed on the FLOW Dashboard using the Raw Data Manager.

Raw Data Manager shows you an account of the received data. The default view shows you data sorted by collection date. You can use the search parameters provided to narrow your search, for example, by survey name or data source. 

**Use the Raw Data Manager to**:

- Check incoming data as it is transmitted from the field.
-	Edit data records individually. 

*Note: If you need to edit more than 20 records, it is recommended to download a Raw Data Report, edit the records, and then re-import the data using the Import Data options.*

1.	On the FLOW Dashboard, click on the **Data Managers** tab. 
 
2.	In the Data Managers menu, select **Raw Data Manager**. 
 
3.	Search by **Survey Group** and **Survey Name** for the survey you imported. You can also search by the other parameters provided. Click **Find**.
 
4.	Click on a row to view data associated with that collection date. The data appears on the right.
