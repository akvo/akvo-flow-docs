
   
Import Multiple Files (Bulk Import)
----------------------------------------

When you conduct surveys in areas where network connectivity is available, data is transmitted instantly to the central FLOW server as soon as you press Submit Survey on the FLOW mobile device. When network connectivity is not available, the device stores the data for later submission or manual retrieval. This stored data can be uploaded in bulk using the Bulk Import feature.

Before you begin:

Ensure that a destination for the data has been created on the Dashboard. For details, see Creating a Survey.

To bulk load data from your mobile phone:

1.	Connect your phone to the computer. <For details, see Using the Phones (from user guide)>
2.	Transfer your completed survey questionnaires and photographs to a single folder. <Not sure how this displays on the phone and how to copy it>

*Note: Survey questionnaires are automatically saved in .zip format. Photographs must be in .jpg format.*

3.	In the Admin Wizard’s Import Data menu, select Bulk Import Surveys. 
 
4.	A file selection dialog appears.
 
5.	Locate the folder containing the files you want to import. Double-click on the folder name to start the upload. You do not need to select each file manually.
 
6.	A dialog displays the progress of your upload. Once the data is successfully uploaded, a confirmatory message ‘Import Complete’ appears.

To check whether all the required data has been successfully uploaded, follow the steps listed in Review Submitted Data.
