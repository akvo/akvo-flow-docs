Configure Gmail on Phone
---------------------------

A free Gmail account is necessary to enable access to the FLOW Dashboard, and to receive software updates. 

It is best to use a dedicated email address for communication with the phone. If you intend to use multiple phones with the Field Survey application, use the same email address for all the phones, so that you can send software updates to all the phones simultaneously.

**To configure Gmail on the phone:**

1.	From the home screen of the phone, press **Settings**. 
 
2.	Under Accounts & Sync or Accounts, press **Add account**.
 
3.	From the list of options, select **Google**. 

4.	You are prompted to specify whether you want to create a new Google account or use an existing one. Choose **New**.
	*Note: If you already have a Gmail account that can be dedicated for communication with the FLOW server, choose 'Use an existing one'.* 
 
5.	Follow onscreen prompts to create your Google account.

The new account will now be visible under **Applications > Email**.
