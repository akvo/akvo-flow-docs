Import Data 
=============

FLOW provides several options to enable you to import data from your computer to the FLOW server. Once the data is available on FLOW, you can use FLOW functionality to review, modify and reuse the data, or view it as a report or Google Earth map.

You can import the following types of data:

- Surveys – Single or multiple files containing collected survey data, or survey templates.
-	Raw Data Reports – Reports generated by FLOW which are saved on your computer for cleansing and analysis.

You can access the Import Data option from Data Managers> Admin Wizard > Import Data on the FLOW Dashboard. Uploaded data can be viewed on the FLOW Dashboard using the Raw Data Manager.

Before you begin:

Ensure that a destination for the data has been created on the Dashboard. For details, see Creating a Survey.
