Add Questions to a Survey
----------------------------

After the FLOW survey is created with all the required details filled in, you can add questions to the survey.

Each survey is organized into question groups which that appear as tabs on the FLOW mobile device or web form. These tabs appear in the question group order that you prescribe.  
 
*Note: Each survey group should contain a Question Group called General where basic information about the location and person being interviewed are recorded.*

Each question group can contain a list of questions. Questions can be of different types and can be configured to ensure clear responses that simplify result collation and analysis.
