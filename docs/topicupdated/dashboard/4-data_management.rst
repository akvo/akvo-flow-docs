Import Data 
=============

FLOW provides several options to enable you to import data from your computer to the FLOW server. Once the data is available on FLOW, you can use FLOW functionality to review, modify and reuse the data, or view it as a report or Google Earth map.

You can import the following types of data:

- Surveys – Single or multiple files containing collected survey data, or survey templates.
-	Raw Data Reports – Reports generated by FLOW which are saved on your computer for cleansing and analysis.

You can access the Import Data option from Data Managers> Admin Wizard > Import Data on the FLOW Dashboard. Uploaded data can be viewed on the FLOW Dashboard using the Raw Data Manager.

Before you begin:

Ensure that a destination for the data has been created on the Dashboard. For details, see Creating a Survey.

When you conduct surveys in areas where network connectivity is available, data is transmitted instantly to the central FLOW server as soon as you press Submit Survey on the FLOW mobile device. When network connectivity is not available, the device stores the data for later submission or manual retrieval. This stored data can be uploaded in bulk using the Bulk Import feature.

Before you begin:

Ensure that a destination for the data has been created on the Dashboard. For details, see Creating a Survey.

To bulk load data from your mobile phone:

1.	Connect your phone to the computer. <For details, see Using the Phones (from user guide)>
2.	Transfer your completed survey questionnaires and photographs to a single folder. <Not sure how this displays on the phone and how to copy it>

*Note: Survey questionnaires are automatically saved in .zip format. Photographs must be in .jpg format.*

3.	In the Admin Wizard’s Import Data menu, select Bulk Import Surveys. 
 
4.	A file selection dialog appears.
 
5.	Locate the folder containing the files you want to import. Double-click on the folder name to start the upload. You do not need to select each file manually.
