Survey Reports 
===============

Survey data that is collected using the FLOW field devices is stored on the FLOW server. To analyze this data, you can run various types of reports from the Dashboard. You can run the following types of reports from the Dashboard:

- Access Point Report - Shows all data for Access Points in the system. See example <link>.
-	Google Earth File - Shows the location of each Access Point in the system. See example <link>.
-	Raw Data Report – Shows all questions and all responses to the questions. See example <link>
-	Survey Summary Report – Shows a summary of survey responses in percentages and frequency counts. See example <link>.
-	Comprehensive Report – Shows raw data, summary data, and a detailed analysis of survey data in graphical and tabular formats.     See example <link>.

Run Reports
--------------

You can run reports directly from the Dashboard or from Admin Wizard. These reports can be saved onto your computer as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, where the results can be filtered and sorted for further analysis. 

*Note: Your Microsoft Excel version must be 2007 or higher.*


To generate a report:

1.	From the Admin Wizard, click Run Reports. 
 
2.	Select the type of report you want to run.
 
3.	Additional dialogs appear based on your selection.

If you selected Access Point Report:

  You are prompted to specify the criteria by which the data should be filtered. Specify what you want to see in the report and click OK.
 
If you selected any other type of report:

  Select the Survey Group of the survey you wish to run from the drop-down list. Surveys that come under that group are then listed for selection in the Survey drop-down list. Then select the survey for which you want to generate a report, and click OK. 
 
The process may take a few minutes, depending on the size of the report.


4.	You are now prompted to specify a location on your computer to store the report file. 
  a.	Select the folder location.
  b.	Provide a name for the file, and type in .xls at the end of the name. For example, WaterPointSurvey_Jan2012.xls. This will ensure that the file is saved as an Excel file.
  c.	Click Save. 
 
5.	To open the report, go to the location where you saved the file and open it. If you are prompted to confirm whether you want to open the file, click Yes.  
 

You can now view the generated report.

Clean Report Data
--------------------

Generated reports may contain errors due to incorrect or inconsistent data entry, or non-compliance with recommended formats. Follow the guidelines in the following table to clean up the data in the Excel spreadsheets.
*Note: Change as little as possible in the original data set. Corrections are only appropriate for typos and incorrectly coded data.*

Error	Correction
--------------------
- Typing errors:	Correct spelling and remove extra spaces between words and letters.
- Incorrect answer coding: 	Code/standardize answer correctly according to pre-determined coding scheme.
- Numerical typos (e.g. 19925 or 0000):	Correct number if the correction is obvious. Reduce multiple zeroes to one zero.
- Numerical outliers:	Make note of survey type and instance number.
- Photos in wrong format:	Convert all photos to PNG or JPG file type.
- Logical Inconsistency:	Look for discrepancies between answers in one instance. 


Generate a Survey Form
-------------------------

To ensure that data collection is not compromised in the event of device failure, you can create a backup paper copy of your survey from FLOW.  Within Admin Wizard, you can generate a form with the questions you created, and then take paper printouts. 

To generate a survey form:

1.	From the Admin Wizard, click Run Reports. 
 
2.	From the list of report options, select Survey Form.
 
3.	Select the Survey Group of the survey you need. Surveys that come under that group are then listed for selection in the Survey drop-down list. Then select the survey for which you want to generate a form, and click OK. 
 
4.	You are now prompted to specify a location on your computer to store the form. 
  a.	Select the folder location.
  b.	Provide a name for the file, and type in .xls at the end of the name. For example, WaterPointSurvey_Jan2012.xls. This will ensure that the file is saved as an Excel file.
  c.	Click Save. 
 
5.	To open the form, go to the location where you saved the file and open it. If you are prompted to confirm whether you want to open the file, click Yes.  
 
You can now view the generated form and print it out.
