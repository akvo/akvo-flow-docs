Clean Report Data
--------------------

Generated reports may contain errors due to incorrect or inconsistent data entry, or non-compliance with recommended formats. Follow the guidelines in the following table to clean up the data in the Excel spreadsheets.
*Note: Change as little as possible in the original data set. Corrections are only appropriate for typos and incorrectly coded data.*

Error	Correction
--------------------
- Typing errors:	Correct spelling and remove extra spaces between words and letters.
- Incorrect answer coding: 	Code/standardize answer correctly according to pre-determined coding scheme.
- Numerical typos (e.g. 19925 or 0000):	Correct number if the correction is obvious. Reduce multiple zeroes to one zero.
- Numerical outliers:	Make note of survey type and instance number.
- Photos in wrong format:	Convert all photos to PNG or JPG file type.
- Logical Inconsistency:	Look for discrepancies between answers in one instance.
