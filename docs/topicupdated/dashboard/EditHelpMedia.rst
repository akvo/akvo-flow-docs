Edit Help Media
-----------------

You can upload helpful tips in a variety of formats for the enumerators to help them complete the survey effectively. These tips can be in different media, for example, photos, videos, text, or activities such as a nearby point locator.

**To add help media to a question**:

1.	Open the question in the survey and click Edit Help Media. 
 
2.	Click Add Help Item.
 
3.	From the Type drop-down list, select the type of media you want to show along with the question. Additional options appear depending on your choice.  
4.	If you selected Photo or Video, click Choose File to select a file from your computer and then click Upload. 

   *Note: Videos should only be taken where cell data connection is very good. Videos can compromise the battery life and number of surveys that can be stored on a phone.*

5.	If you selected Text, enter the help text in the textbox that appears.
6.	If you selected Activity, enter relevant text in the textbox and select an option in the Helper Activity drop-down list. Choices are nearbypoint and waterflowcalculator. The nearby point helper displays all previously surveyed points in the area, listed in the order of their proximity to the survey device. The enumerator can use it to collect data for a point that is already in the FLOW database, thus enabling reporting on the same point over time. The waterflow calculator helps an enumerator to calculate the water flow rate from a water access point while conducting a water point survey. 
7.	Click Save. The help media you selected is accessible to the enumerator from the survey screen on the phone when the user presses the   information icon next to the question.
