Manage Users
================

The FLOW Dashboard is run on the Google App Engine and Amazon s3 Cloud servers. Anyone who has a Google account can log on to their organization’s FLOW Dashboard using their Google login credentials, as long as a corresponding user account has been created in the FLOW database. This user account is created and managed by the FLOW administrator, using the Manage Users feature in Admin Wizard. 

The actions a user can perform on the Dashboard are determined by the permissions assigned to the user account by the administrator.

Within Admin Wizard, you can manage user accounts from the Manage Users page. You can create new users, edit details of these users, and assign the permissions that they need to complete their tasks.

While creating users, limit user permissions by role. Ensure that permissions assigned to users are limited to what is necessary for task completion.

Create a User Account

Only registered users can access the FLOW Dashboard. Follow these steps to create a user account in the FLOW database.

To create a new user account:

1.	On the FLOW Dashboard, click on the Data Managers tab. 
 
2.	In the Data Managers menu, select Admin Wizard. 
 
3.	In the Admin Wizard left pane, select Manage Users. 
 
4.	In the User Name and Email Address fields, type in the user’s name and email address.  Then click Add User.  
 
5.	A user account is created in the system with the details you entered.  A ‘Save Complete’ dialog appears, confirming this. Click OK.
 
The user’s name and email address appear in the table, along with permissions that can be assigned to that user. To know how to assign permissions, see Assign Permissions to a User. 
 

Assign Permissions to a User
-------------------------------

Once you create a user in the system, you must assign them the permissions they will require to complete the tasks they are expected to perform, such as run reports, or create new surveys. As a default, when a new user is created, they do not have any permissions assigned to them.

To assign permissions to a user:

1.	Locate the details of the user in the listing on the Manage Users page. To search for existing users, type in the user name or email address in the search boxes at the top of the page, and click Search. 
 
2.	The user’s details are displayed. In the Permissions column, select the permissions that you want to assign to the user, and click Save. To select multiple permissions, press the Ctrl key (on Windows) or the Command key  (on a Mac) and click each permission you want to assign.  
 
The permissions you selected are assigned to the user. You can follow the same procedure to edit a user’s permissions.

Delete a User Account
-----------------------

To delete a user account:

1.	Locate the details of the user. To search for existing users, type in the user name or email address, and click Search. 
 
2.	The user’s details are displayed. Click Delete to delete the user.
 
3.	You will see a dialog that confirms that the user has been deleted. Click Ok.
