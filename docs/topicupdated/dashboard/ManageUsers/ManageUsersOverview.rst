Manage Users
=============


The FLOW Dashboard is run on the Google App Engine and Amazon s3 Cloud servers. Anyone who has a Google account can log on to their organization’s FLOW Dashboard using their Google login credentials, as long as a corresponding user account has been created in the FLOW database. This user account is created and managed by the FLOW administrator, using the Manage Users feature in Admin Wizard.
 

The actions a user can perform on the Dashboard are determined by the permissions assigned to the user account by the administrator.


Within Admin Wizard, you can manage user accounts from the Manage Users page. You can create new users, edit details of these users, and assign the permissions that they need to complete their tasks.


While creating users, limit user permissions by role. Ensure that permissions assigned to users are limited to what is necessary for task completion.
