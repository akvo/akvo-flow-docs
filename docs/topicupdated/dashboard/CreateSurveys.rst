Create Surveys
------------------

Before you create a survey, identify a Survey Group for it. If a relevant Survey Group already exists, you can create a new survey within it. If a relevant Survey Group does not exist, you must create a new one.

**To create a Survey Group**:

1.	On the FLOW Dashboard, click on the Data Managers tab. 
 
2.	In the Data Managers menu, select Admin Wizard. 
 
3.	In the Admin Wizard left pane, select Manage Surveys. 
 
4.	If a related Survey Group exists, it is listed on the page. Click on the Survey Group name to add a new survey within the group. If a related Survey Group does not exist, click Create Survey Group.
 
5.	Provide a Code (Name) and a description for the new Survey Group. Then click Save and Continue.
 
6.	The new survey appears in the Survey Groups list. Click on the survey group name to continue.
 
7.	Now you can create one or more surveys to be grouped under that survey group. Click Create Survey to add a new survey to that Survey Group.
 
8.	Provide a Name and a Description for the new survey and then click Save and Continue. 

Your survey is saved in the system. You can edit the details of the survey later, as described in Edit Survey Details.
