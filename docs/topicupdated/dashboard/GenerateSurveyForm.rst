Generate a Survey Form
-------------------------

To ensure that data collection is not compromised in the event of device failure, you can create a backup paper copy of your survey from FLOW.  Within Admin Wizard, you can generate a form with the questions you created, and then take paper printouts. 

To generate a survey form:

1.	From the Admin Wizard, click Run Reports. 
 
2.	From the list of report options, select Survey Form.
 
3.	Select the Survey Group of the survey you need. Surveys that come under that group are then listed for selection in the Survey drop-down list. Then select the survey for which you want to generate a form, and click OK. 
 
4.	You are now prompted to specify a location on your computer to store the form. 
  a.	Select the folder location.
  b.	Provide a name for the file, and type in .xls at the end of the name. For example, WaterPointSurvey_Jan2012.xls. This will ensure that the file is saved as an Excel file.
  c.	Click Save. 
 
5.	To open the form, go to the location where you saved the file and open it. If you are prompted to confirm whether you want to open the file, click Yes.  
 
You can now view the generated form and print it out.
