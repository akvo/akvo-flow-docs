Generate Bootstrap File
-------------------------

If network connectivity is low, FLOW provides an alternative way to upload surveys to devices. You can generate a bootstrap file that includes the surveys you want to assign, and email it to users. The files can then be manually loaded onto the device. 

**To generate a bootstrap file**:

1. In the Admin Wizard menu, select **Generate Bootstrap File**.
