Admin Wizard Overview
=======================

The Admin Wizard feature on the FLOW Dashboard enables you to perform administrative tasks related to user and data management. 

Access to each tool on the Dashboard is limited by permissions. All functions are not available to all users. Only a user with Admin permissions can access all the options within the Admin Wizard. Permissions are assigned in the Manage Users page.

Within Admin Wizard you can perform the following tasks, if you have the appropriate permissions:

- Manage user accounts.
-	Manage surveys.
-	Manage survey assignments.
-	Manage authorizations for web surveys.
-	Run survey reports.
-	Import and export survey data.

1.	Log on to your organizationâ€™s FLOW Dashboard (http://flowakvo.appspot.com/Dashboard.html) using your Google Account username and password. FLOW opens on the Dashboard home page. On the top panel, click on the Data Managers tab.
 

2.	From the Data Managers drop-down menu, select Admin Wizard. 
 
3.	This opens the Administration Home page. All administrative options available are displayed along with a brief description of the tasks you can perform with each.
