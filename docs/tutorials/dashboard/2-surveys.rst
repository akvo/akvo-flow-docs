The standard inline markup is quite simple: use

* one asterisk: ``*text*`` (result *text*) for emphasis (italics),
* two asterisks: ``**text**`` (result **text**) for strong emphasis (boldface), and

List markup is natural: just place an asterisk at
the start of a paragraph and indent properly.  The same goes for numbered lists;
they can also be autonumbered using a ``#`` sign::

   * This is a bulleted list.
   * It has two items, the second
     item uses two lines.

   1. This is a numbered list.
   2. It has two items too.
