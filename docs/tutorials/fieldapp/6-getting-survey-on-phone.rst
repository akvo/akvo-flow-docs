Getting surveys on the phone 
=================================

Automatic download of surveys
-------------------------------
1. If you have sucessfully installed the Field Survey app on the phone, and you have a wifi connection, the phone will send a 'beacon signal' to the web-based Dashboard. In the Dashboard, surveys can then be assigned to the phone (XXX-reference-needed-XXX). If this proces fails, please consult the troubleshooting guide (XXX-reference-needed-XXX)

2. Every time the Field Survey app is launched, the application checks for new surveys assigned to it, or updates of existing surveys. If there are new or updated surveys available, it will download them automatically. When new or updated surveys have been downloaded, the status bar will show a notification.

You can see the full notification by drawing down the status bar (put your finger on the top of the screen and slide downwards. Slide upwards again to close the notification screen).

3. The surveys are not displayed immediately. You need to close the application and reopen it. After reopening, the downloaded survey will be shown in the main menu. Sometimes you will need a few attempts before the surveys show up.

Alternative - manual transfer of surveys
------------------------------------------
If there is no wifi available or you have trouble with the connectivity, you can put the survey on the phone using a manual method. This method takes 3 steps: 1) exporting the survey from the Dashboard to a "Bootstrap file", 2) connecting the phone to a computer, 3) transfering the bootstrap file to the phone.

1. Exporting the survey to a bootstrap file
*******************************************
1. Open the Dashboard on your computer

2. In the menu item "Data Managers", select "Admin Wizard". 

3. Select "Generate Bootstrap File" from the list.

5. The surveys in the survey group will be displayed in a dropdown list. Choose the survey you want to transfer. You can select multiple surveys by using the Control-key (on a mac, use the Command-key). After you have made your selection, click "Add selected".

2. Connecting the phone to a computer using a USB cable
********************************************************
1. Attach the phone to the USB port of a computer using the USB cable that came with the phone. If the phone displays a screen that asks you to connect the USB, accept this option.

2. Locate the phone folder on your computer's hard drive. It may be called NO NAME. Open this folder. This folder has the content of the SD card on your phone. Select the subfolder "fieldsurvey"

2. Alternative - Connecting the phone to a computer using the SD card
************************************************************************
If for some reason the phone cannot be connected to a USB cable, you can also get the data of the SD card directly. 

1. Get the SD card out of the phone. Please consult your phone manual on how to do this. Usually, phones have a micro-SD card, for which you need an adapter. What you need depends on your computer. If your computer has an SD card slot, you need a "micro-SD to SD-card" adapter. If your computer does not have such a slot, you need a "micro-SD to USB" adapter. The photo below shows both types of adapters.

2. Connect the SD card to your computer, either using the SD card slot, or through a USB port.

3. The SD card will show up as an external hard disk. It may be called "NO NAME". Open this folder. This folder has the content of the SD card on your phone. Select the subfolder "fieldsurvey".

3 Transfering the bootstrap file
*********************************
1. Download the Bootstrap .zip file by clicking on the link contained in the email. Put the file on your computer somewhere.

2. Locate the phone folder on your computer's hard drive. It may be called NO NAME. Open this folder. Select the subfolder "fieldsurvey". In this folder there will be an empty folder "bootstrap".

3. Copy the bootstrap .zip file to the "bootstrap" folder.

4. After you have completed this, close the window and eject the phone's drive from your computer BEFORE you remove the USB cord from the phone or the computer. If you do not do this correctly, the bootstrap file may not run correctly, and it may cause problems on your computer or phone. The exact order for connecting and disconnecting your phone will vary depending on which model you are using. Your phone models manual might have more information.

5. After you disconnect the phone, open the Field Survey app. The phone notification bar will first read "Loading survey data from SD card", and then "Done loading survey data from SD card".

6. After you see the second message, leave the Field Survey app by pressing the "Back" key on the phone, and open the Field Survey app again. The new surveys will now be added to your home screen. You can now use these surveys to collect data in the field.
