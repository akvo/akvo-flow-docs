Phone requirements and models
==================================

Phone requirements
---------------------
The Field Survey app runs on phones and tablets running the Android operating system. It is highly recommended to run the Field Survey app with at least Android OS version 2.2. At the moment, 93% of all active Android devices fulfill this requirement, and all new phones should have an Android version equal to 2.2 or higher.

Although the Field Survey app can be run on Android version 2.1, this makes it much harder to update versions of the Field Survey software. Therefore, this is discouraged.


The following phone specifications are essential for running the Field Survey app:
	* Runs Android 2.2 or newer
	* GPS
	* Camera

Phone brands
---------------
The Field Survey app should run on any device using the Android operating system. As phone models and specifications change quickly, we cannot make a definite recommendation on which phone to use. We know the Field Survey app has been used successfully on various models of Motorola, Samsung, HTC, and Huawei devices.

Important specifications
---------------------------
The most important specifications of a phone running the Field Survey app are screen size, battery life and camera resolution.

	* **Screen size** - Although the Field Survey app will run on any screen size, surveys are more easy to navigate when the screen size is higher. We recommend using a screen size in the higher display size range, say 3.7 inch or larger. 
	
	* **Battery life** - Longer battery life is better. Ideally, it should be possible to use a phone for taking surveys for a full day without the need for a recharge. In any case, it is a good idea to use :ref:`external backup power <battery_management>` as well.
	
	* **Camera resolution** - Higher resolution is better, if photos are an integral part of they survey that you plan to do. In cases where photos are for identification, this is not critical. In addition, the application reduces the file size significantly from what the phone is capable of for storage and transmission purposes. In practice, anything over 3.2 megapixels will work fine. 
	
	* **SD card size** - The storage requirements of the application depend on the number of surveys with photo's that need to be kept on the phone before the data can be uploaded. Survey data that does not include a photo takes up very little space. In practice, an SD card with 4GB or 8GB storage will work fine for surveys with photo's.
		
	Older versions of the APK (up to 1.3.24) had an issue which could lead to data loss if large numbers of files were kept on the SD storage card. This issue has been solved in newer versions. If you have a version older than 1.3.32, please update the application.
