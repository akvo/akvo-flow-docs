Manage Translations
-------------------

FLOW allows users to enter alternate translations for surveys on the dashboard, and then make those available on the Field Survey app. This allows data collectors in the field to conduct surveys in their local language.

   Survey translations in Akvo FLOW.

To build survey translations into a FLOW survey, you can use the Master Language and Manage Translations tools in the left panel of the Edit Survey screen. The survey elements that can be translated are the question text, option question answers and tooltips. The translations of the survey title, survey description and question group names aren't available on the device yet.

Every survey has a master language. This is the language in which you will first create the survey, and the language in which you will view and edit data in reports, charts and maps. The default is English. You can make a selection when you are initially building the survey.

There are 181 languages available in the language list, but any language with a non-Roman alphabet or any language that reads anything other than left-to-right is not guaranteed to work, as these languages require special character set support on the device. Please contact Akvo to learn more about this.

**To create and publish a survey with one or more translations:**

In an existing survey, first select the master language in the left sidebar. This is the language in which you create the survey.

   To work with survey translations, first set the Master Language, then click +Manage Translations.
   
Click the “+ MANAGE TRANSLATIONS” button in the left panel. This will bring up the Survey translation screen for the survey. Here you can add one or more translations to your survey. Along the top you’ll see the default (master) language, the existing translations (if you’ve created any) and an ADD NEW TRANSLATION dropdown. Below, you’ll see the master survey details on the left, and the details for the translation on the right, with text boxes to enter a translation for each item.

   The screen for entering and managing survey translations.
   
First, select a language from the ADD NEW TRANSLATION dropdown along the top of the Survey translation section. Two buttons, ADD and CANCEL, will appear to the right of the dropdown when you do this. Click ADD to proceed with entering a translation for that language. “Survey details in [selected language]” will appear as the heading for the right-hand translation section.

Enter translations for each survey question, tooltip, and question option (if it’s an option question). The translations for survey title, survey description and question group name will not be visible on the device in this version, but they will be in future versions, so you can enter them as well.

To save as you are working, click SAVE AND CONTINUE at the bottom of the window. To save and return to the master survey screen, click SAVE AND CLOSE. You can always revisit the translation screen by clicking the “+ MANAGE TRANSLATIONS” button from the left panel of the Edit survey section. You can also add multiple translations to a single survey by selecting another language from the Add New Translation dropdown and clicking ADD.

When you have completed the translation(s) of your survey, from the bottom left panel, click Publish. This will display a pop-up window confirming your survey has been published, and instructing to you visit the MESSAGES tab to confirm when this is complete. If you have any unsaved changes, you will first see a warning to Save first.

Once the survey has been published, create a new survey assignment specifying the new survey and all devices that should receive it.
