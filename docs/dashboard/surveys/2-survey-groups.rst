Working with survey groups
--------------------------

The Survey Overview page (see above) shows a list of all survey groups, and the surveys they contain. To see the overview page, click on a Survey Group name in the list on the left. Each survey in the overview shows the date the survey was created, date it was last modified, the type and the master language. There are four actions available for each survey: Edit, Preview, Delete and Copy.
