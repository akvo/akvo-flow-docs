Deleting a Survey
-----------------

To delete a survey, hover your mouse cursor over the survey name in the Survey Overview and click Delete. You will be asked to confirm whether you want to delete the survey.

Note: You cannot delete a survey that contains one or more questions, or that has had any data collected with it. If you are sure you want to delete the survey anyway, please contact Akvo FLOW support staff, who can assist you with this.
