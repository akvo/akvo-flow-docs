Working with survey folders
----------------------------
The Survey page shows a list of all survey folders. Folders can contain other folders, just as in a regular file system on a computer. Folders can also contain a mix of surveys and folders.

**Navigating between folders**

You can enter a folder by clicking on the name. At the top, breadcrumb navigation shows where you are in the folder hierarchy. Clicking on items in the breadcrumb will take you to that folder.
