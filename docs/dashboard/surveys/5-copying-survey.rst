   The copy button for a survey.

This will bring up a window where you can enter the new name of the copied version of the survey and select the destination survey group. If you don't make a selection for the destination, the survey will copy into the current group.

   When you click Copy, you can specify the new name and survey group location for the survey. The default is [survey name] (copy) into the current survey group.
   
When you return to the survey group view where you selected to copy the survey, you'll see it in the group. Because it takes a while to copy a survey, the survey is locked for editing while copying is going on.
