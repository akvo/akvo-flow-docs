Publishing a survey
-------------------

When you are ready to make a survey available to a set of devices, you'll need to publish it. What this does is package up the forms of the survey in files, which the device can then download. After publishing, you can assign the forms of the survey to devices. The publish button publishes all unpublished forms in the survey.

To publish all the forms in a survey, click the 'publish survey' button at the top right of the survey edit screen.  Clicking 'Publish' will not immediately update the publishing states shown in the left panel. This will only be updated if you leave the edit screen and come back later.

   The publish survey button.

Clicking publish displays a pop up window: “Publishing survey: The survey has been published. Please consult the messages tab to see if the publishing has succeeded. This may take a few minutes.” Click OK to dismiss the pop-up.

   After you click publish, a pop up window displays telling you to check the Messages page to confirm that they survey successfully published.

Click the MESSAGES tab from the top menu to move over to the Messages page to confirm survey publishing. Within a few minutes, an entry in the Messages table should appear with the information for the survey just published (Date, Survey ID, Survey, Type, Message, User [will be blank]).

   The confirmation message in the Messages table that the survey has been published.

When you return to the Edit survey screen, you'll see that the version number of the forms has been updated, and the status of the forms now shows as 'Published'.
