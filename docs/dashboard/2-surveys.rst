Surveys
=======

Surveys are the centerpiece of the FLOW application. Create, edit and publish surveys from the Surveys tab. 

When you first visit the Dashboard, you'll land on the Surveys page, with survey groups on the left, and instructions for creating a new survey or survey group in the main page area. If you click on a survey group on the left, you'll see all the surveys in that group in the main page area.
