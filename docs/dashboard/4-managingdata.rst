Managing data
================
The Data tab is where you can view, edit, import and clean data from FLOW surveys.


Inspecting incoming data
------------------------
The Inspect Data table is a live feed of all the data submitted from devices connected to your FLOW dashboard. Its default view contains all data, with the most recent records at the top. You can page through the data using the Next and Previous buttons at the bottom of the table, or filter based on a collection of parameters.
