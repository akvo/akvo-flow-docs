Creating a data collection project
===================================




What is a data collection project?
----------------------------------
Projects are the centerpiece of the FLOW application. Create, edit and publish projects from the Projects tab. 

Looking at the Projects page, you see folders on the left, and instructions for creating a new project or folder in the main page area. If you click on a folder on the left, you will find all projects in that folder in the main page area.

Survey structure in FLOW
------------------------

**Folders**

Projects on the dashboard are kept in folders to help stay organized. Folderscan be organized by any way you'd like - for example, by country, type, organization or year. They are displayed in alphabetical order in the left panel.

**Sub-folders**
Folders can be further categorized into sub-folders. 

**Projects**
These data collection projects consists of forms that collect informations on data points.

**Forms**
Data on data points is collected by one or multiple survey forms.

**Question groups**

Each form contains a series of questions and the questions are organized into smaller sets as question groups.  Each group of questions appears in a separate tab on the device screen. 

**Question Types**

* **Free text** - shows the user a text box on the device to fill in the answer, with no specific format. Text can be letters, numbers and symbols, and appears in the data views and reports exactly as it was typed into the device.
* **Option** - create a set of preset options for the device user to select from on the device when answering the question. Option questions can be single or multiple answer. The survey author can elect to allow 'other' responses, which on the device presents a free text field for entering any other response outside the preset options. Option questions will have frequency analysis performed on them in data analysis.
* **Number** - allows only numbers to be typed into the answer entry field on the device. Optional number settings allow the survey author to allow a sign to be entered with a number, allow a decimal point, or enter minimum and/or maximum values to validate the number entered on the device. Number questions will have basic statistical analysis performed on them in data analysis.
* **Geolocation** - uses the deviceâ€™s GPS to automatically fill in latitude, longitude and elevation. Click the Check Geo Location button to fill in these questions on the device.
* **Photo and Video** - presents the option to take a photo or video as part of the survey. Click the Take Photo or Take Video buttons on the device to access the device camera.
* **Date** - presents a date picker on the device for the device user to select a date in DD-MM-YYYY format.
* **Barcode** - presents the option to scan a barcode from the device and record the barcode number in the survey by clicking the Scan Barcode button on the device. Requires an external barcode scanning-app to be installed on the device.

**Question Features**

* **Tooltips** - survey author can enter hint or tip text that's visible through an info icon next to the question on the device.
* **Dependent** - tick this box on the dashboard to make the current question dependent on the answer from any preceeding option question in the same survey. On the device, the survey will adapt to the answers the user selects while conducting the survey as applicable. You can select multiple answers on which to make the question dependant by highlighting them in the list that appears when you select the preceding dependent question.
* **Mandatory**- tick this box on the dashboard to make a question mandatory, which means that on the device the user won't be able to submit the survey unless they have answered it and all other mandatory questions.
