How this manual should be used
=============================

This manual describes the Field Survey app in detail. However, what you need to know depends on if you are the project manager who manages the data collection and the phones, or if you are an enumerator. If you are an enumerator, you can probably start reading at chapter 5 "Getting started with the Field Survey App".
