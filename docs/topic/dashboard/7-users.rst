About dashboard user permissions
--------------------------------

User permissions on the FLOW Dashboard are divided into two levels: User and Admin. All users can complete the core workflow, but only Admin level users can delete items and have access to the Users tab to view, add and manage other users.

The Users tab contains a table that displays the User Name, Email and Permission Level for all current Admin and User level users. Admin level users can edit and delete users from the Action column.

Adding a new user
-----------------

To add a new user, modify a user's permission level or delete a user, you must have Admin level permission on the dashboard.

From the Manage users table, click the Add New User button. This will display a pop-up that asks you to enter the username and email address for the new user. The email address must be a gmail address in order for the new user to be able to log in to the dashboard. To set the permission level, select either User or Admin from the dropdown menu. Click Save to save changes, or Cancel to discard them. You will see the new user in the table when you return to it.

   Enter or edit the username, email address and permission level.

Editing or deleting a user
--------------------------

To edit or delete an existing user, locate the user in the table and in that row, click the Edit or Delete icon in the Action column.
