Assign Permissions to a User
----------------------------


Once you create a user in the system, you must assign them the permissions they will require to complete the tasks they are expected to perform, such as run reports, or create new surveys. As a default, when a new user is created, they do not have any permissions assigned to them.

To assign permissions to a user:

1.	Locate the details of the user in the listing on the Manage Users page. To search for existing users, type in the user name or email address in the search boxes at the top of the page, and click Search. 
 
2.	The user’s details are displayed. In the Permissions column, select the permissions that you want to assign to the user, and click Save. To select multiple permissions, press the Ctrl key (on Windows) or the Command key  (on a Mac) and click each permission you want to assign. 
 
 
The permissions you selected are assigned to the user. You can follow the same procedure to edit a user’s permissions.
