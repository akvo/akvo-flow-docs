Charts
------

The FLOW Chart Builder is a data visualization tool for viewing individual survey results quickly on the dashboard in graphical form. The basis for Chart Builder are individual survey question responses from option questions. 

To use chart builder, first select a survey group, survey, and question from the dropdown menus. Next select the chart type. Three chart types are available -- doughnut charts (like a pie chart), vertical bar charts and horizontal bar charts. If you would like for the smallest items to be grouped together for better viewing, tick the box next to "Group smaller items."
