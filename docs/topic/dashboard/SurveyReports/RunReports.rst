Run Reports
--------------

You can run reports directly from the Dashboard or from Admin Wizard. These reports can be saved onto your computer as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, where the results can be filtered and sorted for further analysis. 

*Note: Your Microsoft Excel version must be 2007 or higher.*


To generate a report:

1.	From the Admin Wizard, click Run Reports. 
 
2.	Select the type of report you want to run.
 
3.	Additional dialogs appear based on your selection.

If you selected Access Point Report:

  You are prompted to specify the criteria by which the data should be filtered. Specify what you want to see in the report and click OK.
 
If you selected any other type of report:

  Select the Survey Group of the survey you wish to run from the drop-down list. Surveys that come under that group are then listed for selection in the Survey drop-down list. Then select the survey for which you want to generate a report, and click OK. 
 
The process may take a few minutes, depending on the size of the report.


4.	You are now prompted to specify a location on your computer to store the report file. 
  a.	Select the folder location.
  b.	Provide a name for the file, and type in .xls at the end of the name. For example, WaterPointSurvey_Jan2012.xls. This will ensure that the file is saved as an Excel file.
  c.	Click Save. 
 
5.	To open the report, go to the location where you saved the file and open it. If you are prompted to confirm whether you want to open the file, click Yes.  
 

You can now view the generated report.
