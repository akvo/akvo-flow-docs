-----------------  -----------------------------------------------------
Free Text          You want to ask an open ended question where the
                   response will be entered into the phone or web form.
                   For example, “What are your favorite colors?”. 
Option	           You want to ask a question that has a fixed set of 
                   answers. For example, “Are there any current problems
                   with the system?  Yes or No?” 
                   If you choose this question type, you are prompted
                   to fill in the option answers to the question in 
                   Option Details. 
                   Enter an option answer in the text box, and then
                   click Add Option to add additional answers. Use the
                   green arrows to move options up and down in the 
                   order you want. Click Remove to delete an option.
Allow Multiple     Select the checkbox to enable the interviewee to 
                   choose multiple answers. 
Allow ‘Other’      Select the checkbox to list ‘Other’ as a possible 
                   answer. If ‘Other’ is chosen by the interviewee, a
                   text box will appear on the phone or web form as a
                   prompt to provide more details.
                   *Note: Option questions are the only questions upon
                   which dependencies can be built for surveys with
                   dependency trees.*
Number	           You want to ask a question that has a number for
                   the answer. For example, “What year were you born?”
Geo                You want to take a GPS coordinate of a location.
                   Note:  In almost all cases surveys should contain
                   a GEO question. 
Photo	             You want to take a photo as part of the survey.

Video              You want to take a short video as part of the survey.
                   *Note: Videos should only be taken where cell data
                   connection is very good. Videos can compromise the
                   battery life and number of surveys that can be stored
                   on a phone.
Strength           You are asking a qualitative or subjective question
                   and you would like to record how strongly the 
                   interviewee feels about the subject. For example, 
                   “Are you happy with your latrine? Yes or No? Rate on
                   a scale of 1-5. 
Date               You are asking a question that has a calendar date as
                   the answer, in the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY (e.g.
                   2012-05-22). For example, “What was the date of your
                   last committee meeting?”.
Barcode	           You want to ask a question that prompts the
                   enumerator to scan a barcode using an external
                   barcode scanning application.
