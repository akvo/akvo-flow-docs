Manage Web-based Surveys
========================

When you want to collect data from institutions or selected groups of people, FLOW enables you to generate Web-based versions of the surveys as an alternative to phone-based surveys. These surveys can be made available online, with distribution access provided to selected users. 

Once authorization details are entered in the system, a link to the Web-based survey is generated and the user can send this link by email to all the people who should be included in the survey. The link opens the survey form where responses can be entered. Submitted survey data is automatically loaded onto the FLOW server and made available on the Dashboard. 

To enable users to send online surveys, you must first provide them the required authorization within Admin Wizard.
