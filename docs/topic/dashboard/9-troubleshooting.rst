**Discussions**
http://flowhelp.akvo.org/discussions/

If you have a question about how something works, chances are someone else has asked that question before. Search Akvo FLOW Discussions for answers, or just to talk to other users about their experiences. Discussions are fully searchable with keywords.

And if you don't find your answer, you can start a new discussion (public or private!) and an Akvo staff member will help you.

- Problems: Having some issues? Something not quite working right? Post your problems here and we'll try and get to them as soon as possible.
