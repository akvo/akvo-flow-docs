**Discussions**
http://flowhelp.akvo.org/discussions/

If you have a question about how something works, chances are someone else has asked that question before. Search Akvo FLOW Discussions for answers, or just to talk to other users about their experiences. Discussions are fully searchable with keywords.

And if you don't find your answer, you can start a new discussion (public or private!) and an Akvo staff member will help you.

**Survey Groups**

Surveys on the dashboard are kept in Survey Groups to help stay organized. Survey groups can be organized by any way you'd like - for example, by country, type, organization or year. They are displayed in alphabetical order in the left panel of the Surveys tab.
