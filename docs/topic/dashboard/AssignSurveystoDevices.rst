Assign Surveys to Devices 
==========================

To make survey questionnaires available on the field data collection devices, you must assign the survey to specific devices. Surveys must be approved by a FLOW administrator before they can be assigned. 

To assign a survey to a phone you need to know either the device identifier for the phone, the phone number, or the Media Access Control (MAC) address for the phone.
