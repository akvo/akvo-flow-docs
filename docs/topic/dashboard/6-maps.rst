Maps
====

The map on your FLOW dashboard shows all the public data collected on your dashboard. Public data include those collected with surveys of type 'point' and 'public institution'. 

When you click a point icon on the map, a window will slide out from the right that contains photos and data collected at that point. The collection date and point code are listed on the top of the map, below that the photo(s) and below that the survey questions and their responses. You can hide the window by clicking the Hide button in the upper right, or click on a new point to view data. The point whose data is showing in the window is highlighted on the map.

Navigating the map
------------------

There are panning and zoom level tools on the left side of the map. You can also jump around to different countries where your dashboard has data by selecting from the Country dropdown menu in the upper left. If you need a new country added to your FLOW map, contact a member of the the Akvo staff through our support site.


Downloading a photo
-------------------

If a data point has one or more photos, you can click on the photo in the data window and the full size photo will open in a new browser window or tab. From here you can view it in full size and download it.
