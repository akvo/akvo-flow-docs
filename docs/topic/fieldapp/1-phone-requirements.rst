Phone requirements and models
=============================

To run the Field Survey App, your phone must meet the following hardware and software specifications. Supported phone brands include Motorola, Samsung, HTC, and Huawei.

It is essential that the phone you plan on using to collect the data runs Android 2.2 or newer, has GPS, a SD card and a camera. Important things to consider when selecting a particular phone are battery life, camera resolution, durability, screen size and SD card size. 

When in doubt, please consult with Akvo before purchasing devices to run FLOW, especially if you are buying large numbers of devices. If you do not follow these guidelines and/or do not consult with us, there is not much we can do to help.


**Our recommendations:**

THIS SHOULD BE A TABLE:

Note: Although 2.8 inch screens are supported, you may experience issues while typing in data.
Battery life	8-10 hours minimum. External backup power recommended.
Camera resolution	3.2 megapixels or higher
SD card size	4GB or 8GB. SD card must be external, which means you must be able to physically remove SD card from device.
