Phone requirements and models
=============================

Phone requirements
------------------
The Akvo FLOW Field Survey app runs on phones and tablets running the Android operating system 2.2 and higher. At the moment, 93% of all active Android devices fulfill this requirement, and all new phones should have an Android version equal to 2.2 or higher.

The following phone specifications are essential for running the Field Survey app:
	* Runs Android 2.2 or newer
	* GPS
	* Camera

Important specifications
------------------------
The most important specifications of a phone running the Field Survey app are screen size, battery life and camera resolution.

	* **Screen size** - Although the Field Survey app will run on any screen size, surveys are more easy to navigate when the screen size is higher. We recommend using a screen size in the higher display size range, say 3.7 inch or larger. 
	
	* **Battery life** - Longer battery life is better. Ideally, it should be possible to use a phone for taking surveys for a full day without the need for a recharge. In any case, it is a good idea to use :ref:`external backup power <battery_management>` as well.
	
	* **Camera resolution** - Higher resolution is better, if photos are an integral part of they survey that you plan to do. In cases where photos are for identification, this is not critical. In addition, the application reduces the file size significantly from what the phone is capable of for storage and transmission purposes. In practice, anything over 3.2 megapixels will work fine. 
	
	* **SD card size** - The storage requirements of the application depend on the number of surveys with photos that need to be kept on the phone before the data can be uploaded. Survey data that does not include a photo takes up very little space. In practice, an SD card with 4GB or 8GB storage will work fine for surveys with photos.
	
	* **SD card configuration** - The device's SD card must be external. This means that you must be able to physically remove the SD card from the device. Devices that use only internal memory, or any kind of dual SD card arrangement are not compatible with the way the Field Survey app stores information.
		
	Older versions of the APK (up to 1.9.24) had an issue which could lead to data loss if large numbers of files were kept on the SD storage card. This issue has been solved in newer versions. If you have a version older than 1.9.32, please update the application.

Phone brands
------------
As phone models and specifications change quickly and vary from country to country, we cannot make a definite recommendation on which phone to use. We know the Field Survey app has been used successfully on various models of Motorola, Samsung, HTC, and Huawei devices running Android OS 2.2 or higher. We do recommend purchasing devices in the country in which you will be working, to ensure that your devices are locally appropriate and have easily accessible support in the case of technical problems.

When considering models for purchase, you should first consult the general specifications above. When in doubt, please consult with Akvo before purchasing devices to run FLOW, especially if you are buying large numbers of devices. If you do not follow the above guidelines and/or do not consult with us, there is not much we can do to help.
