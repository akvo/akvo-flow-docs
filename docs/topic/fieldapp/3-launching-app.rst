old content from Updating the Field Survey app
==============================================

Occasionally, the software in the Field Survey needs to be updated. The easiest way to do the update is by using the Gmail account that you installed on the phone (see :ref:`installing the Field Survey app <installing-app>`). However, in cases of limited connectivity, a number of alternatives are described below.

Updating through Gmail
---------------------------


1. If you have not already done so: configure email on the phone. You will need to use a gmail account - other email addresses such as hotmail, won't work. It is advisable to use a special email address for this, which is only used to communicate with the phone. If you have multiple phones with the Field Survey app, the same email address can be used for all. In that way, you can send updates to the software to all phones in one go.

2. Get the right Field Survey app (APK file) for your Dashboard. Be careful to get the right one: the Field Survey app and the Dashboard are connected, so you can't simply use any Field Survey APK file for this. You can download the latest version of the APK for your organisation from the Dashboard you have access to, at (XXX-location in Dashboard-XXX) 
 
3. Send an email with the Field Survey app (APK file) as an attachement to the gmail email address that is configured on the phone.

4. Open the email app on the phone. If you don't have the email app icon on your home screen, you can :ref:`create a shortcut <create-shortcut>`. 

.. figure:: img/3-installing-app-2-arrow.gif

   :align: center

Locate the mail.

.. figure:: img/3-installing-app-3-arrow.gif
   :width: 200 px
   :align: center

5. Open the mail. The APK file will be shown as an attachment. The way attachements are shown will depend on the email app.

.. figure:: img/3-installing-app-4-arrow.gif
   :width: 200 px
   :align: center


5. Click "Install". Sometimes you have to click 'Load' first.

   :align: center
   
6. You will see a popup that asks if you would like to replace the application. Click "Ok".
   
.. figure:: img/4-update-app-1.png
   :width: 200 px
   :align: center
   
7. You will see a popup that aks if you want to install the application, with a list of services the application will use. Click "Install"

.. figure:: img/4-update-app-2.png
   :width: 200 px
   :align: center
    
   
The Field Survey app is now installed on the phone. You can now create a shortcut to the Field Survey app on the home screen. This will make starting up the app during field work easier. To do this, just long press on an empty home screen space and choose "Shortcuts" from the menu. Select "Applications", and select the Field Survey app. This will place a shortcut to the Field Survey app on your home screen.

**Troubleshooting** - Sometimes, the previous step will not work, and you will get this message instead:

.. figure:: img/4-update-app-3.png
   :width: 200 px
   :align: center

In that case, you first need to remove the old Field Survey app before you can install the new one.

To remove the old application, take these steps:

1. On the home screen, click the Menu button. On the displayed popup, select "Manage Apps". On some phones, you have to select "Settings", followed by "Applications", followed by "Manage Applications" to arrive in the same menu.

.. figure:: img/4-update-app-4-arrow.gif

   :align: center

2. Scroll down the list and locate the Field Survey app. Click on the icon.

.. figure:: img/4-update-app-5-arrow.gif

3. Information on the application is displayed. Click on "Uninstall"
