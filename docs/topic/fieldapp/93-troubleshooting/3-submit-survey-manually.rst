Submitting surveys manually
=============================

If you don't have a wifi connection, you can upload survey data manually. This process takes 2 steps: 1) getting the data off the phone and on a computer, and 2) uploading the data to the Dashboard. The first step can be done in multiple ways, as described below.

Getting the data off the phone using a USB cable
----------------------------------------------------

1. In the main menu, click "Setings"

3. You should see a message at the top of the phone in the notification bar that says Data has been exported to SD card. If you pull down the notification, it will display the file name of the exported data, for example: wfp2829869345962-all.zip

4. Attach the phone to the USB port of a computer using the USB cable that came with the phone. If the phone displays a screen that asks you to connect the USB, accept this option.

5. Locate the phone folder on your computer's hard drive. It may be called NO NAME. Open this folder. This folder has the content of the SD card on your phone. Select the subfolder "fieldsurvey"

6. In the "fieldsurvey" folder you will see a folder called "surveyal". This folder contains all exported survey data. Copy the entire folder 'surveyal' to a folder on your computer. When this is finished, you can upload the data in the Dashboard (see section below).

   The folder "surveyal" has been copied to a local folder "my-FLOW-data"

Sidenote - The folder has a complicated-looking structure, with a lot of sub-folders with single-digit names. e.g. "fieldsurvey/survayal/3/5/6/2/4/". The actual .zip files, which have names like "wfp10339376830983.zip" are located somewhere in this folder structure. This structure is needed to guard against possible data-loss due to limitations on the number of files in a single directory.

If the survey contains photos, they will not be contained in the .zip file, and instead stored separately as .jpg files somewhere in the same folder structure.

Please take note: although the files have the extention .zip, they are not meant to be unzipped. Instead, the .zip file contains the data in a packed format, meant to be uploaded to the Dashboard.


Alternative - getting the data of the phone using the SD-card directly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If for some reason the phone cannot be connected to a USB cable, you can also get the data of the SD card directly. 

1. Get the SD card out of the phone. Please consult your phone manual on how to do this. Usually, phones have a micro-SD card, for which you need an adapter. What you need depends on your computer. If your computer has an SD card slot, you need a "micro-SD to SD-card" adapter. If your computer does not have such a slot, you need a "micro-SD to USB" adapter. The photo below shows both types of adapters.

3. The SD card will show up as an external hard disk. It may be called "NO NAME". From here on, follow the steps in the section above, starting at step 5.
