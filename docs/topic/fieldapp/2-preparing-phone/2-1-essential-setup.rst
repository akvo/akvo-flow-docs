Essential phone setup
==========================

Before you can start using the Field Survey app, these steps need to be taken:

	1. **General phone setup** - Put the SD card, the Sim card, and the battery in the phone, and make sure everything works.
	
	2. **Set up Wifi** - Connect the phone to wifi network. Click on the menu button and select "Settings". Select "Wireless & Networks". Select "Wifi settings". A list of available wifi networks will be displayed. Choose the one you have access to and provide the password.

	2. **Gmail account** - If you will be using the Gmail-method of getting the Field Survey app and updates on your phone (see :ref:`Installing the Field Survey app <installing-app>` for alternatives), you need to configure a Gmail account on the phone. It needs to be Gmail specifically - other email clients, such as hotmail, won't work. It is advisable to use a special email address for this, which is only used to communicate with the phone. If you have multiple phones with the Field Survey app, the same email address can be used for all. In that way, you can send updates to the software to all phones in one go.
	
	3. **Android settings** - Modify the Android settings to allow the installation of applications from other sources then the Android App Market (now called Google Play). To do this, click on the Menu button and select 'Settings'. Select 'Applications', and enable 'Unknown Sources'.
