Essential phone setup
==========================

Before you can start using the Field Survey app, these steps need to be taken:


	1. **Gmail account** - Configure a Gmail account on the phone. It needs to be Gmail specifically - other email clients, such as hotmail, won't work. This will be the main way to get the Field Survey app and updates on the phone (for alternatives, see :ref:'Installing the Field Survey app<installing_app>'). It is advisable to use a special email address for this, which is only used to communicate with the phone. If you have multiple phones with the Field Survey app, the same email address can be used for all. In that way, you can send updates to the software to all phones in one go.
	
	2. **Android settings** - Modify the Android settings to allow the installation of applications from other sources then the Android App Market (now called Google Play). To do this, click on the Menu button and select 'Settings'. Select 'Applicatons', and enable 'Unknown Sources'.
