Essential phone setup
==========================

Before you can start using the Field Survey app, these steps need to be taken:

1. **General phone setup** - Put the SD card, the SIM card, and the battery in the phone, and make sure everything works.
	
2. **Set up Wifi** - Connect the phone to a wifi network. Click on the menu button and select "Settings". Select "Wireless & Networks". Select "Wifi settings". A list of available wifi networks will be displayed. Choose the one you have access to and provide the password. Check if you have an internet connection.
	
A wifi internet connection is the easiest way to get the Field Survey app and updates on the phone, to download surveys, and to upload data. However, if internet is unavailable, all of these actions can also be performed off-line. Please consult the :ref:`Troubleshooting section <troubleshooting>` for these off-line alternatives.
