Clearing phones of data 
==============================

If you have used a device for a previous data collection, yada yada

Before you can start using the Field Survey app, these steps need to be taken:

1. **General phone setup** - Put the SD card, the SIM card, and the battery in the phone, and make sure everything works.
	
2. **Set up Wifi** - Connect the phone to a wifi network. Click on the menu button and select "Settings". Select "Wireless & Networks". Select "Wifi settings". A list of available wifi networks will be displayed. Choose the one you have access to and provide the password. Check if you have an internet connection.
	
A wifi internet connection is the easiest way to get the Field Survey app and updates on the phone, to download surveys, and to upload data. However, if internet is unavailable, all of these actions can also be performed off-line. Please consult the :ref:`Troubleshooting section <troubleshooting>` for these off-line alternatives.

3. There are a few other (free) applications that can be useful when using FLOW. In particular, these are the FileManager app (XXX-LINK-XXX), the GPS Status app (XXX-LINK-XXX), and the ZXing Barcode Scanner app ((XXX-LINK-XXX)). The FileManager app can be used as a backup option to install and update the Field Survey app, when the email method does not work (XXX-reference-XXX). The GPS Status app enables you to monitor and check the GPS function of the phone (XXX-reference-XXX). The ZXing Barcode Scanner app is needed if barcodes are part of your survey (XXX-reference-XXX).
