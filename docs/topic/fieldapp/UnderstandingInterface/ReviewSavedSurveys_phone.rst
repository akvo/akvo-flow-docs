Review Saved Surveys
--------------------

When you have to stop a survey midway and then continue it later, you can retrieve the partly filled survey using the Review Saved Surveys feature. (For example, you might have to take the GPS location at a water point, and then walk a distance to interview someone to complete the rest of the survey.)  

This feature gives you quick access to:

- Surveys that were saved but not submitted - Click on the survey name to open the survey and continue entering responses.
- Submitted surveys – Click on the Menu   icon and then choose Submitted Surveys. You can view a previously submitted survey, but not edit it.

For details on the options available on this feature, see Survey Menu Options.
