You can use the Settings menu to customize the application as you require, and to perform various other administrative actions. The Preferences option within the Settings menu allows you to configure the way the application should display and handle data.

 
Some features are available to all users while others can only be accessed by administrators and require an administrator access code.

The following table lists the recommended settings for the options within the Preferences menu.
