Overview
==================================
Akvo FLOW is a monitoring platform that enables the effective collection, presentation, and analysis of survey data. Survey data is collected through Android-based smartphones or Web forms and transmitted to a central database called the FLOW Dashboard. The phones can collect a wide variety of data including pictures, GPS coordinates, surveys, and bar code scans. Collected data is displayed on the FLOW Dashboard, on Google Earth maps and several other report formats.
