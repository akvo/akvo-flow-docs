Conducting a FLOW survey
========================

*Note: If you have used your phone in a previous data collection exercise, it is important to clear all the data off of the phone before you begin the next exercise so that you do not run the risk of exceeding the storage limits of your phone’s SD card and potentially losing data. If you use your phone for ongoing data collection, it is important to clear the phone of data at regular intervals.*

Surveys that are assigned to your phone appear on the Field Survey home screen when you launch the application. 

When you click the **survey** icon

for the survey you wish to open, the survey opens, allowing you to enter responses to the questions. When you finish entering responses, you submit the survey and the data is sent to the FLOW dashboard, where it will be stored and analysed.

From within the survey, clicking the **Menu** button will display a menu from which you can select your desired survey language(s) and change the question text size. Other options available from this menu are **Clear** which will erase all survey responses from the screen and **Save and Start New** which will save the current answers WITHOUT sending them to the server and start a new survey.  Once a survey is completed the **Submit** button should always be used to send the data to the central database.

The following table explains the **options displayed in the Survey menu**. 

=========================================	==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Large Text						Makes text appear larger for easy reading. 

Normal text						Changes text size from large to normal.

Clear							Erases all responses entered into the survey without sending it to the server. To clear the response to a particular question, long-click the question text and click OK. 

Save and Start New					Saves current survey responses and starts a new survey, clearing all input values. The saved version appears under the Review Saved Surveys icon on the home screen. You can edit it later and then submit it. 

Languages						Allows you to select one or more languages in which you want the survey questions to appear, if the survey was configured to support multiple languages. 
							*Note: The survey may take a few seconds to reload after switching languages.*

Navigating a survey 
-------------------
Before you begin collecting data, you must understand that each survey contains a series of questions and the questions are organized into smaller sets as question groups. Each group of questions appears in a separate tab on the screen. You can fill in the questions in any order, moving from tab to tab.  

Question types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LINK TO DASHBOARD SECTION INSTEAD?

Surveys can consist of a number of different question types.

- **Free text question** – The answer to the question is entered by the user in free text.

- **Option question** – The respondent can chose between several answer options proposed. For example: Yes/ No/ Maybe. You can set the number of answers allowed. When limiting it to one specific answer, the options are visible through small selectable circles. If you allow multiple answers, the options will be visible as tickable items. 

- **Dependent questions** – Based on the answer to a question, additional questions are displayed or hidden.

- **Mandatory questions** – A survey cannot be submitted without all the mandatory questions being answered. 

- **Number question** – The answer to the question needs to be a number.  You can choose to allow signs or decimal signs and can also set minimum and maximum values to prevent mistyping. 

- **Geo-location questions** - use the device’s GPS chip to automatically fill in latitude, longitude and elevation. Click the Check Geo Location button to fill in these questions.

- **Photo questions** – present the option to take a photo or video to supplement your data. Click the Take Photo or Take Video buttons to use the phone camera. A green check mark appears beside the photo question to indicate that a photo has been taken. *Note: To preview the photo, long-click the checkmark. Press the back button to close the preview. If you wish to replace the photo, click Take Photo again to retake the picture.*

- **Video questions** – It will launch the video camera and instruct the surveyor take a video. (Keep in mind that photos and videos take up a lot of memory when deciding to put in these types of questions).

- **Date** – This will record the date.

- **Barcode** – It will launch the barcode reader app of your phone (You will need to have download it on your smartphone before) and instruct you to scan the barcode of a facility.


Help options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Surveys can be configured to include help options. Help can take the form of text, a series of images or a video. If help is available for a specific question the **help** icon IMAGE help_icon.png is displayed next to the question text. Click this icon to open the help tool.

Submitting a survey
-------------------
When you complete a survey, you must submit it for upload to the FLOW server for storage and analysis. Immediate submission is recommended so that data backup is available in case your phone is lost or damaged. 

When you click **Submit** at the end of a survey, the survey is locked to prevent further editing, and uploaded to the FLOW server immediately. If network connectivity is not available, the survey is queued in the phone until connectivity is restored. The data will automatically be sent to the server. This connection can be via Wi-Fi or over cellular networks. It is easy to check the status of the data transmission within the application under the survey status icon. You also have the option within the phone to select either 2G or 3G networks. If you are in an area where there are only 2G networks, having the phone constantly searching for 3G networks will drain the battery.

It is always better to submit data from the device right away over the network. If users store data on their devices while waiting for an opportunity to import it later, there is always the danger of permanent data loss if the device is damaged or lost.

*Note: Ensure that the date and time setting on your phone is correct before you submit a survey.*

**To submit a survey:**

1.	From within a survey, navigate to the **Submit** tab, which is the last tab in the survey. If there are unanswered mandatory questions, the Submit tab lists these questions. The **Submit** button is disabled till all mandatory questions are answered.
2.	Review the list and enter responses for these questions. You can click on each tab to locate the question and enter a response. The unanswered mandatory questions are highlighted for easy identification.
3.	Once all mandatory questions have been answered, return to the Submit tab and click the **Submit** button.

Saving and reviewing a survey
-----------------------------
Surveys responses are automatically saved as you answer them. If you want to save a partially completed survey for later and begin a new survey, use the **Save and Start New** menu option.

When you have to stop a survey midway and then continue it later, you can retrieve the partly filled survey using the Review Saved Surveys feature.

(For example, you might have to take the GPS location at a water point, and then walk a distance to interview someone to complete the rest of the survey.)  

This feature gives you quick access to:

•	Surveys that were saved but not submitted - Click on the **survey name** to open the survey and continue entering responses.

Icons next to each survey will depict at what stage of transmission it is in. A green check for successful, a yellow dot for queued, a blue arrow for in progress and a red cross for failed. 

If you want more in depth information, long click on an individual submission and then select transmission history.

•	Submitted surveys – Click on the **Menu** icon and then choose **Submitted Surveys**. You can view a previously submitted survey, but not edit it.
  


Checking survey data status and transmission
--------------------------------------------

**To check the survey data status and transmission:**

1.	Open the **Field Survey App**
2.	Click **Survey Status**
