Managing users
=================

Creating a user
-------------------
When the Field Survey app is first opened, you first need to create one or more users. During data collection, a specific user is always selected. When you later examine the data in the Dashboard, you will be able to see who collected a particular piece of data.

To create a user, follow these steps:

1. Select "Manage Users" on the main menu. The current list of users will be displayed. At first, this will be empty.

2. While in the Manage Users screen, press the Menu button of the phone. This will display the "Add User" button.

Remember a user
------------------
By default, every time the application is launced, a user needs to be selected. If you prefer that the application remembers the last user selected, take these steps:

1. Select "Settings" from the main menu.
