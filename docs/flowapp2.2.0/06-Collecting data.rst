Collecting data
==============

*Note: If you have used your phone in a previous data collection exercise, it is important to clear all the data off of the phone before you begin the next exercise. This is vital to avoid the risk of exceeding the storage limits of your phone’s SD card resulting in potential data loss. Before you delete data, make sure all the data has been synced — i.e. they should have a green icon.*
