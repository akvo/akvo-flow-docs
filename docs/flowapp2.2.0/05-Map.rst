Map
===

Maps in the FLOW app allow you to locate your collected data data point on the map. Note that for this to happen, the *registration form* must have been answered, and it must contain a Geolocation question which captures the latitude and longitude coordinates.

You can access the map in two different ways:

1. After selecting your survey you see two tabs, the Data Points tab and the **Map** tab. The map tab displays the location for all the data points created within this survey.

2. You can also check the location of one particular data point. Open the data point, click on the overflow icon, and select **View map**.
