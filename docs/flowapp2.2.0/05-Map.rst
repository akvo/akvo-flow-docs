Map
===

Maps in the FLOW app allow you to locate your collected data data point on the map. Note that for this to happen, the *registration form* must have been answered, and it must contain a Geolocation question which captures the latitude and longitude coordinates.

You can access the map in two different ways:

   1. After selecting your survey you see two tabs, the Data Points tab and the **Map** tab. The map tab displays the location for all the data points created within this survey.
