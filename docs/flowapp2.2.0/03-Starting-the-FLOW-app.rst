   *The new side menu and its items*

... _user_management: 

User management 
--------------------

The first item in the side menu shows you who the active user is. However, there might be multiple users collecting data with this device. Each user should have their own account with a recognizable user name. During data collection, a specific user needs to be selected so that you can later track the collected data to the field worker who conducted the survey. 

This part also allows you to manage your users on this device, to create users and to select a particular user for a data collection activity. 

**Create a new user**

**To create a new user:**
    1. Open the user management field by clicking on the arrow next to your currently active user in the side menu. Now click on **+ User**.
    2. Fill in the name of the user you want to add and select **OK**. If you do not want to add a new user, click **Cancel**.
    3. The new user shows up in the list of users. To select the active user, click on the name.

**Deleting users**

If you want to delete a user long press on the username you want to delete and select **Delete user**. Confirm this action by pressing **OK** in the following screen. The user is now removed from your user list. 

**Remembering users**

You will see a quick message in the bottom of a screen telling you who is the logged in user. If you want to switch between users, you need to select the user via the side menu and the user list.
