Phone requirements and models
=============================

To run Akvo FLOW app, your phone must meet the following hardware and software specifications:

Minimum requirements
--------------------


It is essential that the phone you plan on using to collect the data runs **Android 2.2 or newer**, has **GPS**, a **SD card** and a **camera**. Important things to consider when selecting a particular phone are battery life, camera resolution, durability, screen size and SD card size. 

In order to get full advantage of the map features included in the app, the device must have a *Google Play Services* version installed. Most devices already include this app out of the box, and (usually) users do not have to manually install this software. To check out if your device does include this service, go to your device's *Settings* section, and select *Apps* option. Google Play Services should be listed here.

Some devices do not have SD card support, and have an *external storage* built-in. Many of these devices will still be capable of running Akvo FLOW app, but it is recommended to check with Akvo when this scenario is presented.

When in doubt, please consult with Akvo before purchasing devices to run FLOW, especially if you are buying large numbers of devices. If you do not follow these guidelines and/or do not consult with us, there is not much we can do to help.

	Screen size				    3.7 inch or larger *Note: Although 2.8 inch screens are supported, you may experience issues while typing in data.*

Although Akvo FLOW app does support tablets, the app layout is not yet optimized for large screens. Future versions of the app will have a better UI support. Nevertheless, this is only an aesthetics issue, and the performance of the app does not get affected, as long as the device meets the aforementioned hardware and software requirements.
