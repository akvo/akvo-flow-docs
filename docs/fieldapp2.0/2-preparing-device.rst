Before you install the Akvo FLOW app
====================================
Before you install the Akvo FLOW app on your phone, ensure that your phone is in proper working condition. Place the SD card, the SIM card, and the battery in the phone and make sure you can send and receive calls and data. Once this is done, ensure that your phone is configured to do the following:


Set up Wi-Fi
------------
In order for the phone to update surveys, receive new surveys or transmit submitted surveys, the phone must have a cellular plan with data or must be connected to Wi-Fi. A Wi-Fi Internet connection is the easiest way to connect to the FLOW server for data exchange.

**To connect the phone to a Wi-Fi network:**

1.	On the home screen of the phone, press **Settings**. 

2.	Under **Wireless and Network**, the default setting for Wi-Fi is **OFF**. Tap on **OFF** to change it to **ON**. 

3.	Select **Wi-Fi**. A list of available Wi-Fi networks displays. 

4.	Choose the network you have access to and provide the password, if prompted. 

5.	Select **Connect**. When connected to Wi-Fi, you can see this Wi-Fi icon at the top of the screen:

*Note: In situations where an Internet or data connection is unavailable you need to setup data collection via Mobile networks (H, 3G, E, G). To do this you need to enable ‘Use packet data’ or ‘Data roaming’.*


Set Access Point Name (APN)
---------------------------
Depending on your situation, this section may not be necessary. If your data plan is already working for your phone, you can skip this.

Local Internet service providers use APN settings to activate data plans using SIM cards on phones that were purchased abroad. Every service provider has different APN settings and they change these settings periodically for security reasons. When you purchase the SIM cards, ask the Internet Service Provider to give you the correct APN settings for the SIM Card.

**To set the Access Point name:**

1.	On the home screen, press **Settings**. 

2.	From the options, choose **More…** and then select **Mobile Networks**.

6.	Press the **Home** key when you are done.   
   

Setting data and time on the phone
----------------------------------
Before you start collecting data, it is important to check it the date and time are set correct. The date and time stamp on each data submission takes this information from the phone. If it is set incorrectly, you will get errant date/time stamps. 

**To set date and time:**

1.	On the home screen, press **Settings**. 
2.	Click **date and time**.
3.	Check if the date and time are correct, otherwise change. 


Calibrate GPS
-------------
Every time the phones are moved more than 600 miles (500 kilometers) from the last location where they were calibrated, the GPS system needs to be re-calibrated to ensure GPS coordinates are accurate. The calibration can be done with or without a SIM card in the phone.

If the SIM cards and APN are set correctly on the phone, the calibration process takes only a few minutes. If these are not set correctly, it can take up to 30 minutes.
 
You need to install the free App ‘GPS Status & Toolbox’ from the Playstore. 

**To calibrate GPS:**

1.	Take the phone outside to a location where there is a clear view of the sky. It makes no difference whether the sky is cloudy or clear.
2.	On the phone home screen, click the GPS Status icon

3.	If your GPS is disabled, you are prompted to enable GPS. Select **Use GPS Satellites** and then return to the previous screen. The GPS application appears.

4.	Wait until the margin of error appears and is between 5 and 10 meters. This can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. 


Check SD card status
--------------------
Before you start data collection, you need to check if there is enough space available on your SD card. 

We recommend that at least 2 GB is available. However, 4 GB will be better if you need to collect photos as well. 

**To check how much space is left on your SD card:**

1.	In the home screen click **Settings**, and then **Preferences**.
2.	Click **SD card and storage**.
3.	Here you can see how much is the **total space** and **available space**.
