Downloading forms
=================

There are three ways to get a form from the FLOW server onto your phone:

Automatic download (create form assignment)
-------------------------------------------
Every time the Akvo FLOW app is launched, it checks for newly assigned forms and updates to existing forms. If there are new or updated forms available, these are downloaded automatically. When new or updated forms have been downloaded, the status bar shows a notification. This is the easiest way to get a form to the phone.

When you launch the application, the phone sends a signal to the web-based FLOW Dashboard to indicate that your device is available for form assignments. On the Dashboard, the project manager can assign a form or set of forms to the device, as described here: :ref:`create_survey_assignment`. Assigned forms are automatically downloaded from the FLOW server when your phone is turned on, provided you have internet or network connectivity.

Manual download from settings menu
----------------------------------
You can also manually download a form. However, this is not recommended, as it will not automatically download updates of forms.

**To download a specific form:**

Before you start, you need the ID of the form. On the FLOW dashboard, you can find this if you view the details of the form. 
1.   On the Akvo FLOW app home screen, click **Settings**.

Manual form transfer
---------------------------
Manual form transfer (formerly known as bootstrap) allows you to generate a file of a FLOW form and put it on the FLOW device using a USB cable. This can be useful in situations with low or no connectivity. On the dashboard, you can let the FLOW system email you a zipped version of the form. This file is then placed in the 'akvoflow/inbox' folder on the device. How to do this is described here: :ref:`manual_survey_transfer`.
